<h2>Welcome to Penn Community</h2>
<p>There are over 24,000 students at Penn, but few of us hang out with people outside our immediate academic and social circles. Through organized small group events, Penn Community helps students across campus connect with one another more easily.</p>
<p>My name is Shuo and I've been at Penn as an undergraduate (Wharton '08, Engineering '08) and now as a graduate (Wharton MBA '15) student. The difficulty of meeting other people across campus is something I hear about everyday. Check out my <%= link_to "profile", user_show_path(@@shuo_id) %> or <%= mail_to "shuoz@wharton.upenn.edu", "contact me" %> if you have any comments, questions or feedback about this website. I'm constantly looking to improve the experience for all of you!</p>

<h2>How It Works</h2>
<td>
	<p>1. Anyone with a Penn email address can <%= link_to "Sign Up", new_user_registration_path, method: :get %>.</p>
	<p>2. Browse through the <%= link_to "Event List", events_path %> or <%= link_to "Event Calendar", calendars_path %> to join an event. You can invite up to one guest.</p>
	<p>3. Anyone can also create a <%= link_to "New Event", new_event_path %>.</p>
	<p>4. Want to meet others in the retail industry? Find people for a pickup tennis match? Chat about upcoming travel destinations? Just specify your interests in the event title.</p>
	<p>5. Everyone on the attendance list will receive an email reminder on the day of their event.</p>
